# Potato - Experimental Java Ray Casting 3D Engine

Potato is a simple 3D engine I've been working on as a side project. It's built entirely in Java 8 without any external libraries. The main goal was to create a basic ray casting engine from scratch, just to see if I could do it.
This project isn't meant to compete with professional game engines. It's more of a learning tool and a way to experiment with 3D graphics programming. If you're into low-level graphics stuff or just curious about how 3D engines work, you might find this interesting.
I've included some basic features like texture support, a simple HUD, and even a rudimentary weapon system. There's also a bit of procedural map generation thrown in, because why not?
Feel free to mess around with the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a starting point for your own experiments. Just keep in mind that this is pretty barebones and probably full of quirks.
